# Truflation Index

## About

Truflation is the true inflation index, providing the most objective, decentralized, and frequent inflation updates possible. It represents the US inflation, with many more true fiat inflation indexes to come, as goods and services become significantly more expensive around the world.
 
Based on the Federal Reserve and U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data and calculations, we deconstructed and remastered the consumer price index, the most popular inflation index in the world, to better reflect consumer spending habits and real market price changes.
 
This US Truflation Index takes us out of the middle ages of monetary debate and directly into the future of a decentralized economy through transparent, open-source data collection and access.

## Overview of Truflation Oracle

The Truflation Oracle is an on-chain feed of our custom inflation index available through the Chainlink ecosystem.
 
The Truflation Index API is served to the decentralized Chainlink Oracle on-chain, and made available to compatible smart contracts.

Developers and entrepreneurs can use their oracle with the Truflation Index to source daily updates for projects and products that account for the US dollar’s loss of value.

## How to Use

To use the tool, please follow Chainlink’s [documentation](https://docs.chain.link/docs/architecture-request-model/) for creating a request from within a smart contract. Examples are available from [Chainlink’s official Github](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink). You can also query Truflation’s API directly, for use in off-chain applications.
 
All contracts on Chainlink must be funded using local utility token LINK.
